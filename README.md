# Renge
This is aturn-based tower construction/destruction game with a mass-spring simulation. You can build complex structures (e.g. 'The Eiffel Tower', or 'Sydney Harbour Bridge' ) through a simple UI, that models stress and strain under gravity, wind and earthquakes. You get to take turns to remove a part until the structure fails and collapses spectacularly. This game can be played as a two player - take turns to remove a piece until the collapse.
 
# Learning Experience 
This was a remarkable learning opportunity for me. I have worked on this project in a team environment, we were all determined to build an excellent project. Renge involves some physics including hooke's law which we used to calculate the force needed to extend a spring by some distance &  we also used mathematics including vectors to calculate distance between two points. We used vectors for gravity to open up opportunities for future development.

# Areas for improvement
I have made some observations on what can be Improved. Some features to add include:

• Improve Sound effects <br>
• Add Wind / Earthquake <br>
• Add Graphics  <br>
• Support smaller screens <br>
• Add additional levels of varied difficulty  <br>
• Add customizable features (tension, gravity) <br>
• Score more points based on tension between masses <br>
